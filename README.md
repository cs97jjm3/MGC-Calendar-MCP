## Installation

### Requirements
- Node.js 16 or higher
- Claude Desktop

### Setup

1. **Clone this repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cs97jjm3/mgc-calendar-mcp.git
cd mgc-calendar-mcp
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Build the project:**
```bash
npm run build
```

4. **Add to Claude Desktop:**

Edit your Claude Desktop config file:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add this configuration (replace with your actual path):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mgc-calendar": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Documents\\GitHub\\mgc-calendar-mcp\\build\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Restart Claude Desktop**

## Usage

### Quick Start with Dashboard

The easiest way to use MGC Calendar is through the web dashboard:

1. **Launch dashboard from Claude Desktop:**
   ```
   "Launch the dashboard"
   ```

2. **Click any event** in the calendar to edit it

3. **Add your LinkedIn post** to the Description field (this is your formatted article)

4. **Click "📤 Post to LinkedIn"** - it copies the description and opens LinkedIn

5. **Paste (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V)** in LinkedIn and publish

**That's it!** No manual ICS imports needed when using the dashboard.

### Create Events via Claude

You can also create events by talking to Claude:

```
"Create a calendar event for Article 2 writing session on January 22, 2026 at 2pm"
```

Claude will:
1. Create the event in the database
2. Generate an ICS file
3. Give you the file path to import

### Manage Events

**List all events:**
```
"Show me all my calendar events"
```

**Update an event:**
```
"Update event ID 1 to start at 3pm instead"
```

**Delete an event:**
```
"Delete event ID 5"
```

### Use the Dashboard

**Launch dashboard:**
```
"Launch the dashboard"
```

**Then:**

**Post to LinkedIn:**
1. Click any event in calendar view
2. Paste your formatted article in the Description field
3. Click "📤 Post to LinkedIn" button
4. Paste in LinkedIn and publish

**Create new events:**
- Click empty day in Month view to create event on that date
- Or click "+ Create Event" button

**Edit events:**
- Click any event in Month/Week/List view to edit
- Update title, description, dates, times
- Save changes

**The Description field is your LinkedIn post** - keep it 100-3000 characters and formatted exactly how you want it to appear on LinkedIn.

**The Content field is optional** - use it for article drafts, notes, or additional content you don't want to post.

## File Locations

- **Database**: `~/.mgc-calendar/events.db`
- **ICS files**: `~/.mgc-calendar/ics-files/`

## MCP Tools

This MCP server exposes these tools to Claude:

### create_event
Create a new calendar event with title, description, location, dates, and times.

### list_events
List all tracked events sorted by date (soonest first).

### get_event
Get details of a specific event by ID.

### update_event
Update an existing event. Generates new ICS file with same UID.

### delete_event
Delete an event. Generates cancellation ICS file.

### launch_dashboard
Launch the web dashboard at http://localhost:3737 with calendar views and content editor.

## Features

**Universal compatibility**  
Works with Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, and any app that supports ICS files.

**No authentication hassle**  
No OAuth flows, no API keys, no token management.

**Local-first**  
All data stored locally in SQLite database. Your content, your control.

**Article management**  
Store article drafts directly in calendar events. Perfect for content schedules.

**Proper UID tracking**  
Events can be updated/cancelled across calendar apps using standard ICS UIDs.

**Web dashboard**  
Visual calendar interface with content editor and LinkedIn integration.

**Simple**  
Just works, no complex setup.

## How It Works

**Creating an event:**
1. You ask Claude to create a calendar event
2. MGC Calendar generates an ICS file with a unique UID
3. Event is saved to local database for tracking
4. You import the ICS file into your calendar app

**Updating an event:**
1. You ask Claude to update an event
2. MGC Calendar generates a new ICS file with the SAME UID
3. Database is updated
4. You import the new ICS file
5. Your calendar app recognizes the UID and updates the existing event

**Deleting an event:**
1. You ask Claude to delete an event
2. MGC Calendar generates a cancellation ICS file
3. Database marks event as deleted
4. You import the cancellation
5. Your calendar app removes the event

The UID is the secret. It's how calendar applications know these aren't new events - they're updates to existing ones. This is part of the ICS standard. It's been working perfectly for 27 years.

## Why MGC Calendar?

Most calendar MCP servers require:
- OAuth setup with Google/Microsoft
- API keys and tokens
- Complex authentication flows
- Platform-specific implementation

MGC Calendar uses the universal ICS standard that every calendar app already supports. No APIs, no authentication, just works.

**Old standard beats new API.**

## Roadmap

**v1.1 (in progress):**
- ✅ Web-based dashboard for visual management
- ✅ Article content storage and editing
- ✅ LinkedIn posting integration
- ⏳ Bulk import/export operations
- ⏳ Search and filtering

**v2.0 (planned):**
- Calendar sync without manual ICS imports
- Recurring events support
- Event categories and tags
- Analytics on writing schedule

## Technical Details

**Stack:**
- Node.js + TypeScript
- better-sqlite3 for local database
- ical-generator for ICS files
- Native HTTP server for dashboard
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for Claude integration

**UID Format:**
```
mgc-event-{timestamp}-{random}@mgc-calendar
```

The `@mgc-calendar` domain part isn't a real domain. It doesn't need to be. It just needs to be unique to this system.

## Troubleshooting

**Dashboard won't launch:**
```bash
# Manually start it
npm run dashboard
# Then open http://localhost:3737
```

**Database errors:**
Delete and recreate:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.mgc-calendar
